## Introduction
USBackup is a daemon script that automatically creates backups of an important directory (as configured) to a USB drive in the case of an internet or power outage.

This program is an extremely specific use case, as I live in an area with somewhat spotty internet and power, and since I plan to run a personal fileserver,
I would like to have the files I need often to be accessible in those cases (with little progress lost).
